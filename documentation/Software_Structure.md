# OpenSeizureDatabase Software Structure

## Curator Tools
The curator tools folder should not be needed by most users - it contains the tools to download the data from the 'Data Sharing' server and create the OpenSeizureDatabase .json distribution files.

## libosd
The libosd folder contains a library of python scripts for using and manipulating the OpenSeizureDatabase data.   The software in the user_tools folder uses this library to process the data.

## user_tools
User_tools contains a number of software tools to work with OpenSeizureDatabase Data as described below.

### dataSummariser
summariseData.py will create html summary pages for events stored in the database, plotting raw accelerometer and heart rate data, and also the results from the OSD seizure detection algorithm.

### nnTraining
nnTrainer.py uses OpenSeizureDatabase to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) seizure detector model.

### testRunner
testRunner.py passes OpenSeizureDatabase through user specified seizure detection algorithms in the same way as it would receive the data when implemented on a phone using OpenSeizureDetector.   It calculates statistics for the seizure detection reliability and reliability of detecting non-seizure false alarms corretly.
