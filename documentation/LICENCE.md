OpenSeizureDatabase Licence
===========================

The OpenSeizureDatabase data is licenced under a variation to the Creative Commons CC-BY (Attribution) Licence 
(http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).  The variation is the addition of a clause 3b as shown below:

> 3b - Publication of Results
> ----------------------------
> If you use OpenSeizureDatabase data in the development or testing of a product or system, a detailed description of the product/system
> and the results of a comparision of the product/system performance with that of OpenSeizureDetector must be published in a format 
> that is available to the public free of charge.

This means that it is acceptable to use OpenSeizureDatabase data to develop or test other seizure detection systems, but the
use of OpenSeizureDatabase data must be acknowledged, and sufficient details of the new system must be published in a freely accessible way that it is possible for the OpenSeizureDetector project to benefit from the innovations in the other system. 

Developers of other seizure detection systems are encouraged to contribute data to the OpenSeizureDatabase - if you would like to do this please contact osdb@openseizuredetector.org.uk.   Users of the OpenSeizureDatabase are also encouraged to submit pull requests for improvements to this toolkit, or the OpenSeizureDetector application itself.
