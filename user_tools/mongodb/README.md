MongoDB Tools
=============

It is possible that the best way to filter the .json files is to import them 
into mongodb and use the database's filtering functions, rather than 
trying to write our own in python in libosd.

This folder contains some scripts to set up a docker based instance of 
mongodb and import osdb data into it.

This is just an initial investigation - I do not use this code.
