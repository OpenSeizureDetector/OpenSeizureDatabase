OpenSeizureDatabase Data (to accompany the [OpenSeizureDatabase](http://github.com/OpenSeizureDetector/OpenSeizureDatabase) repository)

The OpenSeizureDatabase data is licenced under a variation of the Creative Commons Share Alike licence, with an additional licence condition to publish results obtained using the data - see the [LICENCE](https://github.com/OpenSeizureDetector/OpenSeizureDatabase/blob/main/documentation/LICENCE.md) description for more details.


NOTE:  A few of the seizures in the database are shown as using the 'Phone' data source.  This data should be treated with caution as we do not know where on the body the phone was located, and the 3d data seems to be incorrect (although the vector magnitude data is correct).
